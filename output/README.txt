
This is the final result from the model used in our paper. Column names are as follows:

- year: year of flow
- o_name: country or region of origin
- d_name: country or region of destination
- q50: the point estimates of origin-destination-specific flows
- q10: lower bound of 80% prediction interval for the point estimates
- q90: upper bound of 80% prediction interval for the point estimates
