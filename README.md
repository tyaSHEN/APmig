# Estimating International Migration Flows for the Asia-Pacific Region: Application of a Generation-Distribution Model
## James Raymer,  Qing Guan,  Tianyu Shen,  Arkadiusz Wi≈õniowski  and Juliet Pietsch 

This is a repository for our paper published in Migration Studies. Our paper estimates annual flows of international migration amongst 53 populations in the Asia-Pacific region and four macro world regions from 2000 to 2019 using a generation-distribution framework. The code to produce this estimate can be found in "Code.r", and input data in "inputs" folder. However, the input data are not actual data used in the paper, so the code is a mere demonstration. To get the result of the paper, you need to refer to the original sources of the data, which are mentioned in the paper and are publicly available.

If you run into problems running the code, please contact me at tianyu.shen@anu.edu.au
